# TrafficSimulator1
Java application to simulate behavior of cars driving on an expressway.

This application can generate a number of lanes, and a number of cars randomly distributed among the lanes. Cars are given random colors. Cars will accelerate to approach a set maximum velocity, but will slow down to tail other cars. Cars can also change lanes randomly, and are more likely to change lanes if they are behind another car.

Some cars are generated with red shades with nonzero aggression levels. Aggressive drivers tail cars more closely, drive faster, and are more likely to change lanes.
